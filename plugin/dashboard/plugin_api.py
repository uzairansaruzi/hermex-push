"""Pairing and restart routes, mounted by the dashboard at ``/api/plugins/hermex-push/`` behind
dashboard auth. Hermex calls ``GET /pairing`` once with the user's dashboard login and stores the
result in the Keychain; no key is ever typed.

Response: ``{"relay_url": str, "install_key": <64 hex>, "preview_key": <base64 of 32 bytes>,
"platform": "hermex", "payload_version": 1, "plugin_version": "<semver>"}``. ``plugin_version``
is the code this process loaded, which lags the files on disk until the dashboard restarts; a
response without it comes from a plugin older than 0.2.0. 409 when ``HERMEX_PUSH_RELAY_URL`` is
unset, because a pairing without a relay could never deliver.

``POST /restart`` (hermex#934) restarts the dashboard process this route runs in, so a plugin
update Hermex installed is loaded without a trip to the host.
