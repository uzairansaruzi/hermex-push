# hermex-push plugin

A `hermes-agent` platform plugin (`hermex`) that posts sealed events to a hermex-push relay on
each turn boundary. Design: [hermex#490](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex/issues/490).
Slice: [hermex#555](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex/issues/555).

Install identifier the app sends: `https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex-push.git/plugin`
(hermes-agent splits it at `.git/` into the clone URL and the `plugin` subdirectory). Enable
with `hermes plugins enable hermex-push`, set `HERMEX_PUSH_RELAY_URL`, restart the gateway.

## Fact checks (hermes-agent v0.21.2 = tag `v2026.9.11`, re-read at v0.21.3)

1. **The turn-end hook fires for webui turns.** hermes-webui runs `AIAgent` in its own process
   with `platform="webui"` (`api/streaming.py`), and every `run_conversation()` ends in
   `agent/turn_finalizer.py`, which invokes `on_session_end`. `invoke_hook` lazily discovers
   plugins, so hooks fire in any process that shares the Hermes home and has the plugin in
   `plugins.enabled`. Hermex's Bot connection runs through the Hermes Desktop backend
   (`tui_gateway`); its sessions carry the source the creating client declared, `ios` for
   phone-created sessions (observed on the owner's host), `desktop` or `tui` for its own
   surfaces. The plugin maps `ios`/`desktop`/`tui` to `source: bot`, `webui` to
   `source: webui`, anything else (including `bot_room` group chats) to `other`. A session whose
   platform the turn hooks never named gets nothing (fail closed), so an evicted chat-platform
   session cannot be pushed to the phone by mistake.
   No plugin change is needed for [hermex#561](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex/issues/561).
   One caveat: the Desktop backend also fires `on_session_end` with `interrupted=True` when a
   socket drops; the plugin sends nothing for interrupted turns, so a turn never pushes twice.
2. **A `kind: platform` plugin can mount a dashboard route.** Dashboard discovery scans
   `<plugins>/*/dashboard/manifest.json` without reading `plugin.yaml`, and
   `_mount_plugin_api_routes` mounts the manifest's `api` file at `/api/plugins/<name>/` once
   the plugin is in `plugins.enabled`. All `/api/` routes sit behind the dashboard's auth
   middleware. So `GET /api/plugins/hermex-push/pairing` works and no QR fallback is needed.
3. **Approvals use the observer hooks, not `register_approval_transport`.** Both exist on
   0.21.2, but a registered transport *replaces* every built-in prompt surface once selected
   by `security.approval.transport`, which would take approvals away from the Bot UI that
   answers them. `pre_approval_request` / `post_approval_response` are in `VALID_HOOKS` and
   observe every surface, so the plugin uses those. Questions come from `pre_tool_call` on the
   `clarify` tool. The `hermex` platform is loaded eagerly (only bundled platforms defer), so
   the hooks are live in every process.

**Profiles.** Sessions run under a Hermes profile scope (`<root>/profiles/<name>`), and each
profile has its own plugin directory, `plugins.enabled` list and `.env`. hermes-agent discovers
a profile's plugins once, on first use, so a per-profile install only takes effect after the
backend restarts. Instead, one install serves every profile in the same process
(`hermex_push/scopes.py`, [hermex#634](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex/issues/634)):
the first copy loaded wraps `PluginManager.invoke_hook` and `has_hook` and pushes for any
profile without its own copy, under that profile's name. That covers the dashboard backend the
Bot connection uses and hermes-webui, including profiles created later; a profile run in its own
process (`hermes -p <name>` in a terminal) still needs its own install. These are hermes-agent
internals: on a host without them the plugin logs one warning and only profiles with their own
copy push. Keys live at the root so every profile pairs as one host, and a profile without
`HERMEX_PUSH_RELAY_URL` inherits the root `.env` value.

## Validated on the owner's host (2026-09-18, hermes-agent 0.21.3)

CLI, webui and Bot turns each produced exactly one sealed `reply` plus `running`/`done`
progress events against a local capture endpoint, alongside Cadu. The captured bodies
contained ciphertext only. The pairing route answered 401 without a login and returned the
keys through the dashboard login.

## What it sends

`POST {relay_url}/installs/{install_key}/notify`, JSON. Ciphertext only; the relay never sees
a title or body. See `hermex_push/payload.py` for the authoritative shapes.

Notification (`kind` is `reply`, `approval`, `clarify` or `turn_error`):

```json
{"v": 1, "kind": "reply", "event_id": "<32 hex>", "thread_id": "<32 hex>", "collapse_id": "<32 hex>",
 "session_id": "…", "source": "bot", "is_subagent": false, "sent_at": 1726600000, "sealed": "<base64>"}
```

`sealed` is base64 of `nonce(12) || AES-256-GCM ciphertext || tag(16)` over the UTF-8 JSON
`{"title","subtitle","body","profile","request_id","bot_name"}`, AAD `hermex-preview-v1:<sha256 hex of
install_key>`. `bot_name` is the name Hermex's bot roster shows (the Desktop title, then
`display_name`, then the Profile, with the default Profile as "Hermes"), read from the host's
`profile.yaml` for each banner and clipped to 80 characters. Hermex builds the banner title from it
and `kind` in the phone's language; `title` carries the same in English (`<name> · Approval
needed`, `· Question`, `· Turn failed`, the name alone for a reply) for older app builds.
Banners render no markdown, so subtitle and body are flattened to plain text before title,
subtitle and body are clipped to 80, 120 and 400 characters. The title is never flattened,
because it is the bot's name and a fixed label; neither is an approval banner, because its body
is a shell command.
A `null` seal means encryption failed on the host; the phone shows a generic
banner. `event_id` is stable per turn or request for relay dedupe; `thread_id` and
`collapse_id` are stable per session. All three are HMAC-SHA256 keyed from the install key.

Progress (Live Activity state, routine updates at most one per session every five seconds,
status changes always through). When the relay answers `no_activity` (no phone shows a Live
Activity for the session), routine updates slow to one a minute after the turn's first 30
seconds; the next update the relay answers otherwise restores the five-second cadence:

```json
{"v": 1, "kind": "progress", "event_id": "…", "thread_id": "…", "session_id": "…", "source": "bot",
 "is_subagent": false, "sent_at": 1726600000, "status": "running", "tool": "terminal", "tool_calls": 3,
 "started_at": 1726599990}
```

Progress carries the tool's name only, never arguments or results. A notification, and the
progress that ends a turn (`done` or `failed`), is retried once after a 5xx or network error.
Other progress is not: the next update replaces it.

## Pairing

`GET /api/plugins/hermex-push/pairing` (dashboard auth) returns
`{"relay_url", "install_key", "preview_key", "platform": "hermex", "payload_version": 1,
"plugin_version": "<semver>"}`. `plugin_version` is the plugin code the dashboard process loaded. It
lags the files on disk (what `hermes plugins list` shows) until that process restarts, so Hermex
can tell an outdated plugin from one that only needs a restart; plugins older than 0.2.0 omit
it. `preview_key` is base64 of 32 bytes. Both keys are generated on first use under a file lock at
`<hermes root>/plugin-data/hermex-push/{install_key,preview_key}` (mode 0600) and never rotated
behind a paired device. They live outside the plugin's install directory so `hermes plugins
update`, a forced reinstall or `remove` cannot unpair a phone; keys from the first release's
location inside the install directory are migrated on first use. The route answers 409 while `HERMEX_PUSH_RELAY_URL` is unset.

## Restart

`POST /api/plugins/hermex-push/restart` (dashboard auth, plugin 0.4.0 and later) answers
`202 {"ok": true}` and about a second later re-execs the dashboard process it runs in with
`os.execv(sys.executable, sys.orig_argv)`, so an update Hermex installed is loaded without a trip
to the host ([hermex#934](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex/issues/934)). Before the exec it
runs the two steps the dashboard's own SIGTERM handler runs (stop running turns and their
foreground commands, flush in-memory transcripts), so running Bot turns end as they would on a
normal stop. The PID stays the same, so launchd, systemd and Hermes Desktop keep tracking the
process, and the command line keeps a `-m` launch and every flag. A `hermes dashboard` started
without `--no-open` opens its browser tab again. Like the dashboard's own POST actions, the route
relies on the app-wide Host check, auth gate and CORS policy, which cover every plugin route.
Hermex probes the public `/api/status` until the dashboard answers, then reads the pairing route
for the new `plugin_version`.

## Layout

- `__init__.py` registers the `hermex` platform and the hooks.
- `hermex_push/keys.py` key files; `privacy.py` sealing and keyed ids; `payload.py` event shapes;
  `sources.py` coarse source and skip rules; `progress.py` coalescing; `relay.py` background POST;
  `hooks.py` hook callbacks; `adapter.py` the send-only platform adapter.
- `dashboard/plugin_api.py` the pairing and restart routes; `dashboard/dist/index.js` a no-op the SPA
  requires.
- `hermex_push_tests/` pytest suite; `fixtures/sealed_preview.json` is a fixed-key vector the
  phone's Notification Service Extension tests can decrypt as well.

`HERMEX_PUSH_RELAY_URL` must be https; plain http is accepted only to loopback (local capture),
because the install key travels in the URL path. Redirects from the relay are refused.

Cron `deliver: hermex` and the `input`, `delivery` and `system` kinds are V1.1
([hermex#566](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex/issues/566)).

## Development

```sh
uv venv .venv && uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python pytest cryptography fastapi httpx pyyaml
.venv/bin/python -m pytest plugin -q
```

`test_restart_needs_the_dashboard_sign_in` runs only where hermes-agent is importable; it skips in
the venv above. To run it against the dashboard itself, use a hermes-agent virtualenv, for example
`uv run --no-project --python <hermes-agent venv>/bin/python --with pytest python -m pytest plugin -q`.

Every merged change under `plugin/` bumps `PLUGIN_VERSION` in `hermex_push/__init__.py` (patch
for fixes, minor for features) along with `plugin.yaml`, `pyproject.toml` and
`dashboard/manifest.json`; `test_plugin.py` fails when the four disagree.

Hosts pick up a change with `hermes plugins update hermex-push` on hermes-agent 0.21.5 or later.
Earlier versions cannot update a subdirectory install, so reinstall there with
`hermes plugins install https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/hermex-push.git/plugin --force --enable`.
Either way the pairing keys survive, and the change takes effect once the Hermes processes that
run agents restart.
